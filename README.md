# 🍔 Fast Food Ordering System (Python)
## 📌 Overview
This is a simple Python console application that simulates a fast food ordering system.
The program displays a menu of food items, lets the user select which items they want to order,
asks for the quantity, calculates the total cost, and then shows the final order summary.

It’s a beginner-friendly exercise that demonstrates:

- Lists and dictionaries in Python
- Loops (for and while)
- User input handling
- Data validation
- Basic arithmetic operations

# 🚀 How It Works
### Menu Display – 
The program shows a list of available fast food items with their prices.
### User Interaction – The user is asked:
- Their name
- Whether they want each menu item
- If yes, how many they want
### Input Validation – Ensures the user only types:
- "yes" or "no" when choosing items
- Numbers when entering quantities

### Order Summary – At the end, the program:
- Displays the ordered items and quantities
- Shows the total price
